  <p>After receiving our Bronze award last year, we are looking to build on our hard work and achieve Silver. We will continue to promote knowledge and understanding of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child throughout our school community. We will consider the positive impact of our journey on children and young people, staff, and on the school’s ethos, practice and environment. We will continue to encourage our  children and young people to see themselves as rights respecting global citizens and advocates for fairness and children’s rights, both locally and globally.</p>

    <p>Colquhoun Park Primary School is going to be 50 in 2018. As part of our celebrations, we would like to hear from past staff and pupils to find out where in the world they are and what jobs they have ended up doing. The Pupil Council is planning to put together a display of the information at our entrance hall so we are also looking for lots of “then” and “now” photos, along with names and dates of when people attended the school. Old school photos would also be appreciated.

      If you know of anyone who attended Colquhoun Park Primary within the last 50 years, perhaps you could help us to get the message out there and invite them to contact the school office by email at office@colquhounpark.e-dunbarton.sch.uk or through our Facebook page – Colquhoun Park Primary Parent Council .Our Pupil Council are keen to get to work in the new year and are excited to hear where our past pupils ended up.</p>
